.SH NAME
\fBmkstegfs\fR \- mkfs binary to create stegfs file systems
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmkstegfs\fR [\fB\-z\fR \fIsize\fR] <\fIfile system\fR> [\fIoptional arguments ...\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBstegfs\fR is a FUSE based file system which provides absolute security. Using
encryption to secure files, and the art of steganography to hide them, stegfs
aims to ensure that the existence of such files isn't guaranteed. Implemented as
a FUSE based file system and using the libgcrypt library to provide the
cryptographic hash and symmetric block cipher functions, stegfs is at the
cutting edge of secure file system technology.

.TP
.BR \-d ", " \-\-dry-run\fR

.SH NOTES
It doesn't matter which order the file system and mount point are specified as
stegfs will figure that out. All other options are passed to FUSE.
.P
If youâ€™re feeling extra paranoid you can now disable to stegfs file system
header. This will also disable the checks when mounting and thus anything could
happen ;-)

Note on spelling: As albinoloverats.net is a British company and \(lqlicence\(rq
is the correct spelling in its native language. However, the name of the
licences, written in most cases in America, feature the American spelling of the
word, license. As part of the title of the official licensing document it was
thought inappropriate to alter the spelling. In British English, license is the
verb, licence is the noun and licensee is the person who is granted a Licence.
