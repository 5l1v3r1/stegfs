stegfs - 2015.00                                          ---- ---- ----
================

Changes
-------

* Complete rewrite **NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE**
  - Stores block locations (and other vales) as big endian
  - Change key/IV processing
* Remove multithreaded capability (we’ll bring it back soon)
* Files are:
  - Read when they’re opened
  - Written when they’re closed
  - Cached until the file system is unmounted

Ideas For Another Day
---------------------

* Bring back multithreaded support
* Allow user configured algorithm (select during mkfs)
* Cache time limit (force forget if a file isn’t accessed)
* Don’t break backwards compatibility (again)!

About
-----

stegfs is a steganographic file system in userspace. Steganographic file
systems allow the user plausible deniability of files within. It
achieves this by becoming a lossy file system: writing a file to the
file system may overwrite an existing file without warning.

The typical use case for stegfs is either as a file on an existing file
system, similar to many other FUSE based file systems, but it can also
function as a file system on its own partition, like traditional
“in-kernel” file systems---it doesn't really matter. With that in mind,
it’s not expected to be a primary workstation file system, but more of a
USB or SD-card file system. Great for keeping documents hidden from
prying eyes when moving data between systems. (It also works well with
online based storage provides too.)

One suggested way of using stegfs is to have it located as the final
partition on a USB drive, and keep less secret data in the root or
within one or two subdirectories, and then keep more secret data further
down the hierarchy---obviously with each file having a unique password.

stegfs uses a file hierarchy similar to that of conventional file
systems. However, all directories must start with a + symbol; allowing
stegfs to easily distinguish between files and directories. For each
subdirectory, a check is made to ensure that the current block isn’t
already being used by another file down that path. Files written at
deeper levels will not overwrite files above them, but files in the root
directory are likely to overwrite portions of files further away from
the root. Therefore, files at a deeper level are less likely to
overwrite another file, but are more susceptible to being overwritten
themselves.

NB ‐ Files and directories do not need to be created, they already
exist, just try stat’ing a file to see what this means ;‐) (that said,
just because a file might exist doesn’t mean it does or contains any
valid data).

Files can be stored with or without a password. The convention adopted
for stegfs is “/dir/tree/file:passwd”; that is, everything after a colon
is used at the password for encrypting and decrypting the file. In
addition to this, as with the directory hierarchy and the file name, the
password is also used to locate the header blocks for files.

mkstegfs
--------

When creating a stegfs file system, the size of the file created (or the
size of the partition on which it will be created) is shown; this is the
number of bytes (MB, GB, etc) which are used to house everything,
including header information, about the files on the file system. Below
this is the capacity available for actual file data ‐ 5/8 of a block is
used for data (see below). Finally, the maximum usable space under ideal
conditions where no files are compomised: each file is written 9 times
to minimise the loss, and maximise the chance of being able to recover
it. Under normal working conditions it’s highly likely this value will
never be achieved due to the Birthday Paradox.

Build/Installation
------------------

* Simply
  $ make
  # make install

* Eventually you may need the following
  $ make clean
  # make uninstall

Technical Data
--------------

Units used here (and through-out stegfs) are in powers of 2 - think 1024
not 1000.

Each file system block is 128 bytes, with 80 being used for actual data,
with the rest being used to verify the integrity of the data, and point
to the location of the next block. (Yes this makes it VERY inefficient,
but the possibility of not being able to retrieve data eclipses this.)

Using 64 bits to represent the block numbers allows up to 1.845e19
blocks. This allows a theoretical maximum partition size of 2ZB, and a
theoretical capacity of over 1.25ZB. Although the maximum file size will
always be 1/9 of the overall capacity due to file replication.

In practice, due to the limits of the open64() function used by the GNU
C Library and the Linux kernel, the maximum usable limit stands as 8EB.
This gives approximately 70 trillion blocks, equalling upto 5EB of
available storage space. (Other limits may exist on other systems.)

RAM requirements for stegfs are a little on the high side too: it will
use between 0.8% and just over 1.6% of the total file system size. This
might not seem like much but if you were to have a 1TB stegfs partition
it would need at least 8GB of RAM to even start, and in excess of 16GB
if you were to fill it to capacity!
